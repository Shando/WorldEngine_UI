        # Ok, some explanation here because why the formula is doing this may be a
        # little confusing. We are going to generate a modified gamma curve based on 
        # normalized temperature and multiply our precipitation amounts by it.
        #
        # numpy.power(t,curve_gamma) generates a standard gamma curve. However
        # we probably don't want to be multiplying precipitation by 0 at the far
        # side of the curve. To avoid this we multiply the curve by (1 - curve_bonus)
        # and then add back curve_bonus. Thus, if we have a curve bonus of .2 then
        # the range of our modified gamma curve goes from 0-1 to 0-.8 after we
        # multiply and then to .2-1 after we add back the curve_bonus.
        #
        # Because we renormalize there is not much point to offsetting the opposite end
        # of the curve so it is less than or more than 1. We are trying to avoid
        # setting the start of the curve to 0 because f(t) * p would equal 0 when t equals
        # 0. However f(t) * p does not automatically equal 1 when t equals 1 and if we
        # raise or lower the value for f(t) at 1 it would have negligible impact after
        # renormalizing.
